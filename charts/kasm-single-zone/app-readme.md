# Kasm Workspaces (kasm-single-zone)
## Overview
Kasm Workspaces provides secure, containerized, and browser-accessible workspaces for a variety of applications and industries. It delivers isolated and secure environments that can be accessed via web browsers, eliminating the need for local installations and enhancing security by keeping sensitive data within your infrastructure. Kasm is ideal for providing VDI, remote browser access, and secure access to development environments.

The `kasm-single-zone` Helm chart simplifies the deployment of a single-zone Kasm Workspaces instance on Kubernetes, enabling rapid deployment and management of your virtual workspace infrastructure.


## Highlights
- **Browser-Based Access:** Access workspaces from any modern web browser, regardless of the user's operating system.
- **Containerized Environments:** Provides isolated and secure workspaces using Docker containers.
- **Centralized Management:** Manage and scale your workspace infrastructure from a single control plane.
- **Enhanced Security:** Keep sensitive data within your infrastructure and leverage Kasm's security features.
